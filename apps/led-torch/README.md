## led-torch

An LED flashlight app that uses the powerful LED camera flash, as a flashlight!

This app requires SysToolsMgr Service to function correctly.

App style customized to a dark motif as generally you'd be using the flashlight in the dark and certainly don't want a bright screen to throw off your vision.

In addition, I've added a slider bar to adjust the brightness from 50mA to 200mA (18mA to 150mA on the Pre3). And of course, there's the central toggle button that turns the LED flashlight on and off
