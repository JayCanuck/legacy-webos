		<b>Step 1)</b> The first thing you need to do is open up the DevMode app that's hidden in every webOS device.<br><br>
		Normally, this can be done by typing "webos20090606" in Universal Search/Just Type.<br><br>
		<img src="images/setup/device1.png" class="device-image"/><br><br>
		However, as you're using this app, all you need to do is...<br>
		<div x-mojo-element="Button" id="btnDevMode"></div><br>
		<b>Step 2)</b> Turn the toggle on. This will enable DevMode and allow WOSQI to connect to your device.<br><br>
		<img src="images/setup/device2.png" class="device-image"/><br><br>
		<b>Step 3)</b> If you get prompted for a DevMode password, enter it. If you have never set a password yet, then don't type anything and hit submit.<br><br>
		<img src="images/setup/device3.png" class="device-image"/><br><br>
		<b>Step 4)</b> If you get prompted to reset, then go ahead and do so.<br><br>
		<img src="images/setup/device4.png" class="device-image"/><br><br>
		<b>Step 5)</b> Plug in your USB cable to your computer and your device. Depending on your version of webOS, you'll want to choose Just Charge or Close (not USB Mode).<br><br>

		<b>Step 1)</b> Go to this webpage: http://bit.ly/wosqi-java<br><br>
		That page will show you what version you have installed. You will need Java SE 6 or later.<br><br>
		<b>Step 2)</b> Download the current version of WOSQI to your computer (save it wherever you want) from: http://bit.ly/wosqi-download<br><br>
		<b>Step 3)</b> Run WebOSQuickInstall.jar by double-clicking it.<br><br>
		<b>Step 4)</b> If your computer doesn't have the Novacom drivers already installed, you'll be prompted.<br><br>
		<img src="images/setup/computer1.png" class="computer-image"/><br><br>
		Choose the "yes" option. The driver will then download.<br><br>
		<img src="images/setup/computer2.png" class="computer-image"/><br><br>
		After the download completes, it'll install the driver. Installation will be different depending on your OS, but it should be relatively straightforward.<br><br>
		<img src="images/setup/computer3.png" class="computer-image"/><br><br>
		<b>Step 5)</b> If all went well, WOSQI should be loaded successfully, with your device selected in the dropdown box in the upper right area.<br><br>
		<img src="images/setup/computer4.png" class="computer-image"/><br><br>
		You are now able to use WOSQI with your device. And anytime you want to use WOSQI in the future, all you need to do if choose Just Change/Close on your device and you'll be good to go (assuming you leave DevMode on).
