===========
ComicShelf is only for webOS 2.x devices (specifically, armv7 devices like the Pre2)

Comic book files need to go into /media/internal/comics/

Basic interface is there:
	- Single tap on the image hides/shows the UI buttons.
	- Standard image manipulation (pinch zoom, panning, etc.)
	- Swipe to left/right or use next/previous buttons to move between images
