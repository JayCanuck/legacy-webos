WebOS Clock Theme Builder
***
The built-in webOS app was designed by Palm with expandability in mind.

This program, WebOS Clock Theme Builder, builds upon the existing Clock app's theme framework and lets users create full themes, either based on existing themes (just with replacement images) or full fledged original themes from scratch.

The created themes don't use any patches and don't replace any system images. Rather, it uses a unique new format that is OTA update safe.

Do note: installing a clock theme will not override any Clock settings; it simply adds a new theme option to the popup listings. In fact, you could install every clock theme available if you so desire.
