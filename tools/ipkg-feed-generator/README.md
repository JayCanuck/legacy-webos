===================
webOS Ipkg Feed Generator
***
A very basic and very fast java program that creates ipkg feeds, for use by programs like WOSQI and Preware.

Just put the jar file in a directory with the ipk files. Then run the jar and a it'll generate proper "Packages" and "Packages.gz" files.

It's just that simple :)

One great usage is putting ipk files in a Dropbox public folder. Just run the jar from inside that folder and you'll have your own personal feed for use in WOSQI and Preware.
